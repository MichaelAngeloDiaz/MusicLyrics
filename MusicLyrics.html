  <h2>Song Lyrics</h2>
 

  <span style="background-color:#DAF7A6">
    Let's break up, not make up this time
I feel like I got no answer
So let's break up
But not make up this time
This time<br></span>
    <p>We fight
Then you leave me
You come back
And I'm shaken
When will it end?
Cuz I'm tired of endless break up
Of endless make up<br> 
   </p>
  <p>I'm toxicated by you and by us
I can't do this anymore
Anymore, so<br>
  </p>
  <h2>Chorus</h2>
<span style="background-color: #DAF7A6">Let's break up, not make up this time
I feel like I got no answer
So let's break up
But not make up this time
This time
This time

Huh, this time
Yeah <br> 
  </span>
  <p>To be honest
I don't know what I should do to make this better
Cuz I'm over feeling like this
I know we did our best
    <br> </p>
  <p>I'm toxicated by you and by us
I can't do this anymore
    Anymore, so<br>
  </p>

  <span style="background-color: #DAF7A6">Let's break up, not make up this time
I feel like I got no answer
So let's break up
But not make up this time
This time
This time<br></span>

  <p>Huh, this time
Yeah<br></p>

  <p>All my time
I spent all my time on you
For us to work
I guess we're not meant to be
To be
Woah <br></p>

<span style="background-color: #DAF7A6">Break up
Not make up
Let's break up
  This time...</span>
